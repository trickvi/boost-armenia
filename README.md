# Armenia BOOST

The Armenia BOOST government expenditure database is constructed with
data publicly available (in Armenian) at the Armenian e-government
website, managed by the Ministry of Finance. The data included in the
database ranges from 2006 to 2013 and comprises expenditures carried
out by the central government.

The national budget classification contains one level of
administrative classification, four levels of economic classification,
three levels of functional classification, and one level of program
classification. The database also classifies expenditures by
expenditure type and identifies intra-budgetary transfers.

Database users should be aware of the potential limitations of the
datasets. We urge users to consult the users’ manuals to learn more
about these limitations and take them into account when analyzing
their countries’ budgets.
